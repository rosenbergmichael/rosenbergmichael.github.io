Hi there!  Welcome and thank you in advance for taking the time to read this first blog of mine, as well as all of my future blogs.  I am a Software Engineering student at the Flatiron School and I’m so incredibly excited to be a new member of this amazing community.  

First, allow me to provide some background as to how I got here.  I graduated college back in 2013, and at the time I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do next in life.  I had a business management degree, but hadn’t figured out what exactly I wanted to do with it.  My first job out of school was a purchasing position, and I spent about 5 years at that company (probably a few years too many) until I decided that I wanted to try something new, as I wasn’t enjoying what I was doing.  I then started a sales job in March of 2019 which I had for almost 1 year before unfortunately being laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  I was doing sponsorship sales for a B2B events company, and once the pandemic hit, my company (being in the events industry) was understandably hit hard which led to numerous layoffs.  I liked this job a bit more than the purchasing gig I had for the previous 5 years, but deep down I really wasn't happy at either.

Neither of my previous two jobs felt like a good fit for me.  I found myself just going through the motions a lot, and waiting for the clock to strike 5:00 every day.  In addition, at both jobs I had this feeling of being expendable and I was always struggling to grow and advance, all while earning not so great salaries.  The truth is, me being laid off from my sales job due to the coronavirus pandemic was a blessing in disguise.  I had this feeling of freedom, and I also now had the time to take a deep dive into what other career paths were out there, in order to find a career “home” where I could grow both professionally and personally, all while finally being happy and enjoying what I do.

After doing some soul searching and exploring my options at this point in my life, I was introduced to the world of Coding and Software Engineering.  I quickly realized that this could be the answer to what I wanted to do with my career.  A lot of things interested me about Software Engineering as a career, besides everything I was reading about flexible work schedules and great salaries (definitely bonuses!).  For starters, these types of jobs seem to never be boring, each day challenging you with new problems that need to be solved.  In addition, I also love the fact that you never stop growing, as there are always new things to learn (such as new languages) that you can add to your skill set in order to help you further advance your career.  Last but not least, I feel confident in saying that these types of jobs will always be in demand both now and even more so in the future, as the world continues to shift towards digital.  My curious nature, knack for problem solving and interest in technology also reassured me that my decision to enter the world of Software Engineering was the right move. 

Software Engineering seems to not only be an incredibly valuable skill to learn, but also an excellent career path for someone like me who gave other careers a try but was still looking for their next and final career change.  It also seems to check all of the boxes of what I’m looking for for my future, and I can’t wait to begin my journey here at Flatiron School!
